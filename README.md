# auction-app
This repository is created with the purpose of further developing an auction app I created during my time at Linköping University.
Originally, the web app was written in JavaScript and the intention is to rewrite the application in TypeScript.


## Technical Specification 🛠️

This app is an auction application which allows users to view, bid and make comments on auctions.
It features a simple and user-friendly interface which feels fast and snappy even on slow networks.

This application is built using the MERN stack.
